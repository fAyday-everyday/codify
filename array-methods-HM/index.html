                    When you gonna see I'm not for sale
                    I've been questioning
                    When you gonna see I'm not a part of your machine
                    Not a part of your machine

                    No, I'm not scared of the beast in the belly
                    Fill my cup with endless ambition
                    And paint this town with my very own vision</li>

                <li>
                    Cool out, cool out
                    
                    Just before I go
                    Yes I know that I'm losing control, yeah
                    I wanna take things slow, put my mind cruise control
                    I know I'm always pacing
                    And I blame it on the pressure I'm facing
                    I wanna take things slow, put my mind cruise control</li>

                <li>You're always saying that you're read my sign and
                    Always wishing that I'll take the time but
                    You know that's not my speed
                    Only believe what I can see
                    I live my life in black and white
                    I know that's not what you would like
                    That's all I know, I put my mind and cruise control</li>

                <li>Oh, hush, my dear, it's been a difficult year
                    And terrors don’t prey on innocent victims
                    Trust me, darlin', trust me darlin'
                    It’s been a loveless year
                    I'm a man of three fears
                    Integrity, faith and crocodile tears
                    Trust me, darlin', trust me, darlin'</li>
